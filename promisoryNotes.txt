Subject: Promissory Note for Completion of OJT Hours

Dear Maam,

Good day!

I, Christian Barbosa, a fourth-year student of Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at Leyte Normal University, respectfully submit this letter as a formal promissory note.

I sincerely acknowledge that I have not yet completed the required number of hours for my On-the-Job Training (OJT) for Second Semester, AY 2024â€“2025. In this regard, I humbly request to be allowed to receive my grades for the OJT course, with the commitment that I will diligently complete the remaining training hours.

I fully understand the importance of fulfilling the OJT requirements as part of my academic obligations. I promise to comply with all requirements and submit the necessary documents once I have finished my training hours. I assure you that I am taking this matter seriously and will complete the necessary hours needed.

Thank you very much for your kind consideration and understanding. I remain committed to upholding the standards and integrity of our institution.

Respectfully yours,


Christian Barbosa
